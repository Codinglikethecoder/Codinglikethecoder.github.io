I’m  super positive sports fan and an Office (U.S) fan. I’m a first generation american with Haitian roots.  I have a pretty diverse work history which has taken me all over NYC and Long Island. I have been a coach, teacher and team lead. I have been on the support side of the Saas industry for 14 years and was looking for a new challenge. I’m so excited to take this journey with my new cohort and learn some of the techniques that I see at work everyday.

I look forward to getting to know all of you and continuing this great journey.
